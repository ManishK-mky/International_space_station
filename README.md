<h1>International Space Station (ISS) Tracker</h1>
Welcome to the International Space Station (ISS) Tracker project! This project aims to provide real-time information about the current location of the ISS, allowing users to track its position as it orbits the Earth.

<h2>About</h2>
The ISS orbits the Earth approximately every 90 minutes, traveling at a mind-boggling speed of about 28,000 kilometers per hour (17,500 miles per hour). With its rapid movement, knowing its current location is both fascinating and informative.

<h2>How it Works</h2>
This project utilizes data from sources like NASA and other space agencies to fetch accurate information about the ISS's position. By leveraging this data, we present users with the ISS's current coordinates, altitude, and ground track on an interactive map.

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Real-time tracking of the ISS's location.</li>
<li>Displays current coordinates, altitude, and ground track.</li>
<li>User-friendly interface for easy navigation and exploration.</li>

<h2>Why Track the ISS?</h2>
Tracking the ISS is not only a captivating endeavor but also educational and informative. It allows amateur astronomers, educators, and space enthusiasts to observe the space station passing overhead. Furthermore, it offers insights into ongoing space exploration efforts and the collaborative international projects that sustain the ISS.
